# FakeStackOverflow  

FakeStackOverflow is a **React + TypeScript** web app that replicates Stack Overflow’s core functionality, enabling users to post questions, view answers, and interact with a dynamic Q&A platform. While currently frontend-only, I plan to expand it into a **full-stack MERN** application.  

## Features  
- **Post & Answer Questions** – Submit and respond to queries.  
- **Sorting & Filtering** – Sort by newest, active, or unanswered; filter by tags.  
- **Search & Pagination** – Easily find relevant discussions.  
- **Voting & Comments** – Upvote/downvote answers and engage in discussions.  
- **Authentication & Moderation** – Secure login, role-based permissions, and content flagging.  
- **Design Patterns** – Implements **Command, Strategy, and Observer patterns** for maintainability.  

## Tech Stack  
**React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Vite, Cypress**
